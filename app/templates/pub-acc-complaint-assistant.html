          <p>Please check one of the boxes below to tell us what you would like
            us to do with the information you are providing on this questionnaire.
            If you would like to file a charge of public accommodations
            discrimination, you must do so within 365 days from the date you were
            allegedly discriminated against.  If you do not file a charge of
            discrimination within the time limit, you will lose your ability
            to file a charge.  If you would like more information before filing
            a charge or you have concerns about the FCHR notifying the organization
            about your charge, you may wish to check Box 1.  If you want to file
            a charge, you should check Box 2.<p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>BOX 1: {{form.box_1}} I want to talk to an FCHR employee before deciding
                whether to file a charge.  I understand that by checking this box,
                I have not filed a charge with the FCHR.  I also understand that
                I could lose my ability to file a charge if I do not file in time.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <blockquote>
              <p>BOX 2: {{form.box_2}}  I want to file a charge of discrimination, and I authorize
                the FCHR to look into the discrimination I described above.
                I understand that the FCHR must give the organization that I
                accuse of discrimination information about the charge, including
                my name.  I also understand that the FCHR can only accept charges
                of discrimination based on race, religion, sex, pregnancy,
                national origin, disability, age, genetic information, or
                retaliation for opposing discrimination.  By signing below, I
                verify that I have read the above information and that the facts
                stated are true.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><i>NOTE: If you have checked Box 2 above, and your case is already
                350 days or more from the alleged discrimination, the FCHR will
                accept this form as a charge if it meets the elements of a charge.</i></p>
